<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<ul>
     <li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li>
     <li>¼ teaspoon ground paprika</li>
     <li>¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
     <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
     <li>10 chicken wings</li>
     <li>2 cups vegetable oil for frying, or as needed</li>
     <li>¼ cup butter</li>
     <li>¼ cup hot sauce</li>
     <li>1 pinch ground black pepper</li>
     <li>1 pinch garlic powder</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>

<ol>
     <li>Whisk together flour, paprika, cayenne pepper,
         and salt in a large bowl.</li>
     <li>CPlace chicken wings in the bowl with flour
         mixture and toss until evenly coated. Transfer 
         wings to a 9x13-inch glass baking dish and arrange
         in a single layer. Cover and refrigerate for 1 to 1 1/2 hours.</li>
     <li>Add about 1 inch oil to a deep, heavy 
         skillet; heat to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
         (The oil should be just enough to cover wing entirely.)</li>
     <li>Meanwhile, combine butter, hot sauce, pepper, and garlic
         powder in a separate small saucepan over low 
         heat. Cook and stir until butter is melted and
         mixture is thoroughly blended. Remove from 
         the heat and reserve for serving.</li>
     <li>Fry coated wings in the hot oil for 10 to 15 minutes,
         or until they begin to crisp and turn brown. 
         Maintain the oil temperature while cooking. 
         Remove cooked wings from hot oil and let 
         drain on paper towels or a wire rack.</li>
     <li>Transfer wings to a platter and drizzle hot sauce 
         over top; or mix wings and hot sauce in a bowl until coated.</li>
